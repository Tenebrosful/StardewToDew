# Release Notes

## Version 1.3.0

* Add an overlay that displays the list all the time (when enabled
  in the configuration).

* Fix rendering of long items.  (More specifically, fix the rendering
  of the subsequent items so they don't overlap the additional line(s)
  of the long item.)  As part of this, change the highlight style from
  being a different background color to being a rectangular border instead.

## Version 1.2.0

* Tighten up the spacing between items in the list

* Add the "secondary close button" configuration option, check
  for controller inputs as well as keyboard inputs to tell when
  to close the list

## Version 1.1.0

* If the Mobile Phone mod is installed, add a To-Dew "app" to it.
  (This is really just an icon that brings up the same interface
  as the hotkey.)
